    <h3>About this game</h3>

    <p>
      We worked together as a class to build this project.
      It uses Twine, which lets you draw a set of nodes to
      make a "choose your own adventure" story.  In this
      project we used variables, loops, and conditions.  
      We also learned how to format text and add custom 
      fonts.

      <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/459729493/">A Mazing Game</a>
    </p>
    <p>By Miriam</p>

    <h3>About this project</h3>
    <p>
      To do this project, I used Scratch, which is both 
      easier and harder than people might think to use.
      It's easier because you don't have to memorize any
      commands, but you still have to have a mindset that
      will guide you towards the goal. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The hardest part was tuning up the difficulty level
      so it was possible to beat without being so hard it
      was no fun.

    <p>By Jonathan</p>

    <h3>About this project</h3>

    <p>
      I used a technology called Twine, which is an online
      programming tool.  It is designed to make adventure
      games.  I modified it to make a form of blackjack.
      It was harder than I anticipated.  I had to cut a 
      lot of corners to make it work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned some programming concepts like if / else
      statements, variables, and formatting.

    <h2>Blender Model - Still life with furniture</h2>

      <a href = "furniture.png">Furniture image</a>
    </p>  

    <p>By Daniel</p>

    <h3>About this project</h3>
    <p>
      I built this image with Blender, a 3D modeling program.
      I learned basic modeling functions such as rotate, 
      extrude, and translate.  I learned how to set up custom
      materials to give objects color, and how to set up lights
      and a camera.  
    </p>

    <p>
      3D modeling is a lot more complicated than I thought,
      but it is a lot of fun.
